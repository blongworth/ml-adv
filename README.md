# ml-adv

Arduino library for Norkek Vector ADVs.

Currently has functions for starting ADV in streaming mode and for reading and parsing ADV data. Data is currently parsed to text; need a better return format (structure or class variables).

`lib` contains library code and headers.

`src` contains a simple example. This should include the library and run as is with the PlatformIO IDE. Change `.cpp` to `.ino` for use with Arduino IDE.
